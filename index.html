                <p>Hello, I'm Randy Luna, and I'm currently in my fourth year pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Alberta. Before embarking on my journey in Computer Science, I earned a diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Singapore Polytechnic. Despite the apparent contrast between these two fields of study, I firmly believe that my background in Mechanical Engineering has significantly enriched my growth as a Software Engineer.</p>

                <p>Through my experience in Mechanical Engineering, I honed a design thinking approach to problem-solving. This approach involves breaking down complex challenges into manageable subsets and systematically finding solutions. It has proven to be a valuable asset in my journey as a Software Engineer, allowing me to approach coding and development with a structured and innovative mindset.</p>

                    <p>I am the Frontend Developer of the University of Alberta Blueprint's Chapter.  I have been responsible for designing and developing responsive and user-friendly interfaces using React and Material UI. I have successfully maintained and updated existing web applications, ensuring their continued functionality.</p>
                    <p> Additionally, I have played a key role in developing RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js to interact with MongoDB databases. My work involves version control using Git, and I have been following the Agile methodology for effective project management.  </p>

                    <p>During my time at Singapore Polytechnic, I engaged in a significant six-week final year project focused on carbon fiber composite failure analysis methods. This experience deepened my understanding of engineering principles and cultivated a problem-solving perspective.
                                            </p>
                    <p>Our project encompassed fabricating composite specimens, brainstorming designs for a drop-weight test apparatus, and evaluating multiple design alternatives. The report reflects our progress and outlines challenges faced in the initial phase, setting the course for the remainder of the Final Year Project.</p>
                    <p>Through this experience, I developed a holistic problem-solving approach, learned to navigate constraints, and gained an appreciation for trade-offs, shaping my academic and professional approach.</p>

                    <p>I worked with the Indigenous Women's Rights at Bartolina Sisa Women's Organization and OMIOCH to develop an App to facilitate the accessible, convenient, and up to date dissemination of the rights and protections of indigenous women. The app allows information to be posted by Indigenous Women’s organizations, and downloaded when users are online for offline viewing. The app also facilitates communication between Indigenous Women through user generated content.</p>
                    <p>I utilized React Native to create a user-friendly and responsive frontend for an Indigenous Women's Rights app. This was essential to ensure accessibility, even in areas with limited internet access. For data storage and management, I implemented PostgreSQL. On the backend, I used Django to facilitate article and forum post management by admin users. Rigorous testing was conducted using React-native Testing library, Jest, and Detox to ensure the highest quality and reliability of the application.</p>

                        Calm the F(ood) Down is a delightful 2D cooking game where players take on the role of a chef fulfilling customer orders. The challenge lies in preparing the necessary ingredients, cooking them to perfection, and serving the dishes promptly. What sets this game apart is its unique approach to difficulty—instead of the typical life system or timer, players face the intriguing twist of managing a stress level threshold. Success hinges on your ability to keep your cool and manage stress amidst the chaos of a bustling kitchen. Calm the F(ood) Down not only offers an enjoyable gaming experience but also serves as a valuable lesson in stress management within a dynamic and engaging environment.</div>

                        We've developed a comprehensive time management mobile application designed to help users effectively track their activities, including focusing, cooking, exercising, meditating, and coding. Our app not only offers pre-defined categories but also empowers users to create custom tasks and monitor their time allocation. Much like the 'Screen Time' feature on iOS devices, our application generates insightful weekly graphs that showcase how users spend their time on various tasks. This feature enables users to gain valuable insights into their productivity and time management habits. The application is built using a robust tech stack, including Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, and React Native, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.                    </div>

                        Our motivation behind creating the Second Chance app was to provide a seamless and supportive transition for individuals seeking refuge in a new country, particularly amidst the worsening global refugee crisis. We recognized the importance of offering the best possible support to those in need. To achieve this, we developed the application using the powerful MERN stack.

                        On the frontend, we harnessed the capabilities of React in conjunction with Material UI to craft a user-friendly and intuitive interface. Meanwhile, our backend was meticulously constructed using a combination of Express and MongoDB, complemented by the integration of various APIs. This robust setup was orchestrated to run smoothly on a Node.js runtime. Our aim is to empower refugees with a digital tool that eases their transition and enhances their access to essential resources and assistance.                    </div>
