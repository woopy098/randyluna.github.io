                <p>hi my name is Randy Luna, i am a 2nd year Undergrad at the University of Alberta studying Computer Science. Before pursuing my degree, i graduated with a diploma in Mechanical Engineering in Singapore Polytechnic.even though Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering are two different fields of study, i believe my experience as a Mechanical Engineering has helped me greatly in developing me as a Software Engineering as through Mechanical Engineering, i had developed a design thinking approach to solving solutions by splitting the problems into subsets and solving them systematically.</p>

                        calm the f(ood) down is a simple 2d cooking game that involves customer making orders where the player, as the chef, will then have to prepare the necessary ingredients, cook said ingredients, and finally serve them to the customer. While most games use a life system or a timer for the losing condition, the catch in calm the f(ood) down is that the player will lose once they reach a certain stress level threshold. Thus, the point of this game is to learn how to manage stress in an otherwise stressful game.

                        We built a time management mobile application that you can use in order to keep track of your time focusing, cooking, exercising, meditating and also coding. We plan on also adding a feature on this app where the user can create their own specific task and keep track of their time while completing the task. Similar to the “Screen Time” on IOS devices, our application will also provide the user with a graph of how much time they spent doing each task at the end of the week so the user can see their progress.The app is build with express.js, mongodb, node.js and react-native</div>

                        We decided to build the Second Chance app to allow individuals to better transition to the country they seek refugee in with ease. Especially nowadays when the refugee crisis is worsening as time goes by, it is important that those who seek refuge receives the best support they could possibly get. We created the application using the MERN stack, where we used React along with Material UI to create the frontend and used a combination of Express and MongoDB, in combination with several APIs, running on a Node.js runtime for the backend.</div>
