                <p>Hello, I'm Randy Luna, and I'm currently in my final year pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Alberta. Before embarking on my journey in Computer Science, I earned a diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Singapore Polytechnic. Despite the apparent contrast between these two fields of study, I firmly believe that my background in Mechanical Engineering has significantly enriched my growth as a Software Engineer.</p>

                <p>Through my experience in Mechanical Engineering, I honed a design thinking approach to problem-solving. This approach involves breaking down complex challenges into manageable subsets and systematically finding solutions. It has proven to be a valuable asset in my journey as a Software Engineer, allowing me to approach coding and development with a structured and innovative mindset.</p>

                    <p>I am the Frontend Developer of the University of Alberta Blueprint's Chapter.  I have been responsible for designing and developing responsive and user-friendly interfaces using React and Material UI. I have successfully maintained and updated existing web applications, ensuring their continued functionality.</p>
                    <p> Additionally, I have played a key role in developing RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js to interact with MongoDB databases. My work involves version control using Git, and I have been following the Agile methodology for effective project management.  </p>

                    <p>As a DevOps Intern at Voyager Systems, I designed and implemented FreeBSD and VMware ESXi projects, focusing on server optimization and automation. I configured jails as reverse proxies with Nginx, managed SSL/TLS protocols for secure communications, and wrote shell scripts to automate server tasks. I conducted quality assurance checks on MariaDB databases, developed and executed test cases for website functionality, and ensured system reliability through meticulous testing and validation processes.</p>

                    <p>I worked with the Indigenous Women's Rights at Bartolina Sisa Women's Organization and OMIOCH to develop an App to facilitate the accessible, convenient, and up to date dissemination of the rights and protections of indigenous women. The app allows information to be posted by Indigenous Women’s organizations, and downloaded when users are online for offline viewing. The app also facilitates communication between Indigenous Women through user generated content.</p>
                    <p>I utilized React Native to create a user-friendly and responsive frontend for an Indigenous Women's Rights app. This was essential to ensure accessibility, even in areas with limited internet access. For data storage and management, I implemented PostgreSQL. On the backend, I used Django to facilitate article and forum post management by admin users. Rigorous testing was conducted using React-native Testing library, Jest, and Detox to ensure the highest quality and reliability of the application.</p>

                        Calm the F(ood) Down is a delightful 2D cooking game where players take on the role of a chef fulfilling customer orders. The challenge lies in preparing the necessary ingredients, cooking them to perfection, and serving the dishes promptly. What sets this game apart is its unique approach to difficulty—instead of the typical life system or timer, players face the intriguing twist of managing a stress level threshold. Success hinges on your ability to keep your cool and manage stress amidst the chaos of a bustling kitchen. Calm the F(ood) Down not only offers an enjoyable gaming experience but also serves as a valuable lesson in stress management within a dynamic and engaging environment.</div>

                        We've developed a comprehensive time management mobile application designed to help users effectively track their activities, including focusing, cooking, exercising, meditating, and coding. Our app not only offers pre-defined categories but also empowers users to create custom tasks and monitor their time allocation. Much like the 'Screen Time' feature on iOS devices, our application generates insightful weekly graphs that showcase how users spend their time on various tasks. This feature enables users to gain valuable insights into their productivity and time management habits. The application is built using a robust tech stack, including Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, and React Native, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.                    </div>

                        The Indigenous Women's Rights App, developed for the Bartolina Sisa Women's Organization and OMIOCH, empowers Indigenous women with resources and a platform for community engagement. As a Full Stack Developer (Sept–Dec 2023), I built a responsive frontend using React Native and a Django backend for managing articles and forums. PostgreSQL was used for data storage, and I ensured reliability through rigorous testing with React Native Testing Library, Jest, and Detox. This project enhanced my technical skills and understanding of challenges faced by Indigenous communities.
